# AWS S3 Learning Project

## Overview

This project is a basic Node.js application initally designed to interact with Amazon S3, one of the many services provided by AWS. The purpose of this project is to gain hands-on experience with AWS SDK, specifically focusing on performing basic operations with S3 buckets, such as uploading files and listing the contents of a bucket.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a learning tool. It helps in understanding how to set up and configure AWS SDK in a Node.js environment and how to execute common tasks using S3. This is part of a broader initiative to build robust projects utilizing various AWS modules.

## Features

- **File Upload**: Upload files from your local system to an S3 bucket.
- **List Files**: Retrieve and list all files stored in a specific S3 bucket.

## Future Scope

While this project is currently focused on S3, the ultimate objective is to explore and integrate more AWS modules, building a robust and scalable application that leverages the full power of AWS.

## Conclusion

This project is a stepping stone towards mastering AWS services. It provides a foundational understanding of working with AWS SDK and S3, which can be expanded upon in future projects involving more complex AWS modules.
